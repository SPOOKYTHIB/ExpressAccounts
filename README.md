# ExpressAccounts
A simple app that lets you register, login, and access a page only when you are logged in.

# Prerequisites

You will need to have **Node.js** installed on your computer. Grab it from the [official website](https://nodejs.org/en/) if necessary.

# Installation

Simply open the project's root in a terminal window and enter `npm install`. This will install all the required dependencies, assuming **Node.js** is installed. Some warnings might appear; ignore them, as they will not be a problem.

Then, enter `npm start` and you will be able to access the app at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
